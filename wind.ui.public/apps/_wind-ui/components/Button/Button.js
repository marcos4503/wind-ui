//Component "Button" JavaScript Code
/*
/* All the JavaScript code for your component goes here.
/* It is highly recommended that you wrap your component code in a static class or at least
/* include the name of your component in the name of your global functions and variables.
/* There is no need to do this on variables created within functions.
/* Example
/* function componentYourComponentName_yourFunctionName(){}
/* var componentYourComponentName_yourNameVar(){}
*/
/*
/* If you wrap your component JS code within a static class, you must use YourClassName.variable
/* to access your variables and YourClassName.method() to access your methods.
/* Methods within static classes are declared with "static yourMethodName()"
/* Variables within static classes should always be declared with "var yourVariableName"
*/
